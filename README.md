# Complete Unity Developer 2D - Number Wizard UI

This is the [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught nearly half a million students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub)

## In This Section
We add interactable user interface and scene loading to our previous Number Wizard guessing game code. (ref: UI_CUD)

## How To Build / Compile

## Lecture List

**After watching (learning outcomes)**
Create nice looking buttons that can be used for awesome functionality.


### 5 Button Click Loads Scene ###

**In this video (objectives)**

1. Create public method to load the next scene.
2. Add build index to scenes.
3. Hook up start button with LoadNextScene() public method.


**After watching (learning outcomes)**

2. Implement all the buttons, text, images required for the game screen.
3. Ensure all game objects are properly named and ready for action.


**After watching (learning outcomes)**
Implement UI elements required for our core game from our game design.


### 8 Import & Refactor Code ###

**In this video (objectives)**

1. Import our NumberWizard.cs code from previous section of the course.
2. Assess what needs to be refactored / changed in order to have our code work with our user interface.
3. Refactor the code including player input mechanism.

**After watching (learning outcomes)**
Refactor our code so that it is ready to hook up with our user interface.


### 9 Using ToString() ###

**In this video (objectives)**

1. Hook up our buttons to the previously created methods.
2. Link our UI text field to our code.
3. Use ToString() to convert our integer into a string to be displayed in our text field.

**After watching (learning outcomes)**
Connect a variable in our code with a text field in our UI.


### 10 Use Random.Range() ###

**In this video (objectives)**

1. Use Random.Range() for our guess to introduce randomness.
2. Refactor our code to only have 1 place of calculating guess.
3. Tweak our logic to prevent the computer from guessing a number already guessed.

**After watching (learning outcomes)**
Use Random.Range() to add randomness to the number guessed.


### 11 Polish & Standalone Build ###
